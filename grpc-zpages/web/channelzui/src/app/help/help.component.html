  <h2>Java notes:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>InProcessTransport is not a real socket, so in process servers and channels will
      not provide socket level stats. If you try to load an InProcesTransport, channelz will
      report that the socket is not found. This is normal. Use the provided channel, subchannel, or
      server level stats instead.</li>
